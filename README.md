# Honeycomb Efficiency Analysis

As a scientist fascinated by the intricate designs and structures found in nature, particularly the honeycomb of honey bees, I am captivated by the hexagonal design's elegance and efficiency. This project aims to explore and model the structural efficiency of the honeycomb pattern, seeking to understand why hexagons are nature's preferred shape for cell construction. Through mathematical modeling and documentation, we will demonstrate the superior efficiency of hexagonal cells compared to other regular shapes.
